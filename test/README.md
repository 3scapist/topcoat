## Running the tests

To run the tests `clone` the repo, and start a localserver from ./topcoat (suggestion `python -m SimpleHTTPServer` on osx/linux will start an http server on port 8000 in that folder). In order no to duplicate the css files all the topcoat dependencies for the tests are in `./topcoat/release`. Navigate to the specific address and you'll be able to run the tests.
